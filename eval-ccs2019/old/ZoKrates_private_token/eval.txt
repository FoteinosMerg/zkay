Private Token
-------------

The Private Token scenario works as follows:
    1) User 1 registers (announcing public key; initializing balance to 0)
    2) User 2 registers (announcing public key; initializing balance to 0)
    3) User 1 buys 5 tokens
    4) User 1 "secretly" sends 3 tokens to User 2
    5) User 2 receives the 3 tokens from User 1

1. Gas usage and cost
---------------------

The costs are computed as of June 14, 2018

Step 1: Register User 1
    Gas used: 82908
    Approx. gas cost: 0.0005804 ETH ($0.28265)

Step 2: Register User 2
    Gas used: 82908
    Approx. gas cost: 0.0005804 ETH ($0.28265)

Step 3: Buying
    Gas used: 1788851
    Approx. gas cost: 0.012522 ETH ($6.09821)

Step 4: Sending
    Step 4.1: Depositing proof
        Gas used: 448542
        Approx. gas cost: 0.0031398 ETH ($1.52908)

    Step 4.2: Sending the tokens
        Gas used: 1824511
        Approx. gas cost: 0.0127716 ETH ($6.21977)

Step 5: Receiving
    Step 5.1: Depositing proof
        Gas used: 448377
        Approx. gas cost: 0.0031386 ETH ($1.5285)

    Step 5.2: Receiving the tokens
        Gas used: 1729843
        Approx. gas cost: 0.0121089 ETH ($5.89703)

TOTAL gas used: 6405940
TOTAL approx. gas cost: 0.0448416 ETH ($21.83786)

Remarks:
    - The intermediate steps in 4 and 5 are necessary to avoid the "stack too deep" exception

    - In practice, with encryption available, the registration of users would be more expensive,
    needing a verification contract for itself (a user registering has to proof that what he claims
    to be a balance of 0 actually is a balance of 0)
